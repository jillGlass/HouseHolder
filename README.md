React Native App

My first attempt to build an app with React Native.

This is a Job To Do list that enables a user to add and delete items from a list, using a modal to add a new job, as well as assign each job to a child. I followed a tutorial to learn how to create the job and delete from the list. I taught myself how to add the name selection modal and the name selection logic that changes the colour of the input jobs to represent which child was chosen (they're my kids :)

It's been heaps of fun learning React Native and building this out.
